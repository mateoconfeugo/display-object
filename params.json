These channels when written to will change each the cms and html wondering if we can use a persistant queue or something like that to make undo and redo easy.  When the changes need to be saved/persisted on the server side,  The editor/layout manager can update the server which is updating edn files for the particular display object.\r\n\r\nNew display objects can be created from existing display objects.  Template html is simple inserted in the right spot and written to the html channel, same for css\r\n\r\nDisplay objects get bound to their host element by the layout manager.\r\n* When the data channel receives data via push, event, pull whatever\r\n** Data read from channel land given to the snippet function which returns the new html\r\n** the html is inserted into the target host element\r\n\r\nlayout manager consumes the html output channels and directs it to the correct set of target host elements\r\ndisplay objects sample html could be edited in place\r\n\r\nthe same could be said for the css\r\n\r\nhandler function editing on line can be accomplished by integrating kimera.\r\n\r\nthe layout manager has a map that connects the target host elements to the html output channels of the display objects.\r\nThe layout manager can be used to edit, add and remove display objects.\r\nOperations that make sense.\r\n\r\n(render-display-objects )\r\n(route-html-to-host )\r\n(route-html-to-hosts )\r\n(add-display-object  )\r\n(remove-display-object  )\r\n(list-display-objects  )\r\n(add-filter/transform )\r\n(remove-filter/transform )\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
